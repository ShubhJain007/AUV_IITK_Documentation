# <a name="title"></a> Hydrophones
We are using Aquarin AS-1 hydrophones in our AUV. Currently we are still in the development phase for the same. We plan to use them with our CDAQ 9223 along with some pre-amplifiers. 

We will be using labView software for the signal processing. As soon as we get up things running they will be updated here.
